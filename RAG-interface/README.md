# FAIR GraphRAG Next.js Frontend
This is the user interface for the FAIR GraphRAG system and a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). An LLM serves as a chatbot and enables querying a knowledge graph stored in Neo4j for data analysis purposes.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Prerequisites
- A (FAIR) knowledge graph stored in Neo4j graph database
- Azure model access to query OpenAI or open-source LLMs

## Environment

Create a `.env` file by copying and editing the provided `.env_dummy` file and adding your credentials:

```bash
cp .env_dummy .env
```

## Open Project

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Open [http://localhost:3000/chat](http://localhost:3000/chat) to see the chat interface.

You can start editing the landing page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
